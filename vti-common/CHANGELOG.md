### Added

- **vta-vault**: Resolve mdoc issuers against configured IACA trust anchors ([#987](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/987))

Answers the one question mdoc asks differently from every other credential
  format here: which key do I trust to have issued this?

  Every other format names its issuer as a DID, so receiving resolves that DID
  and verifies against whatever comes back — the VTA holds no list and there is
  no operator step. An mdoc has no issuer DID. It carries an X.509 chain in the
  issuerAuth COSE unprotected header (x5chain, label 33): a Document Signer
  certificate issued by an IACA. Verifying it means the VTA must already hold the
  roots it accepts, which is a trust store, not a lookup.

  The decision taken is a configured set of IACA root certificates — how
  production EUDI verifiers work, and what Member State trusted lists (ETSI TS
  119 612) distribute. It keeps X.509 at the boundary: nothing below this module
  learns certificates exist, and receive_mdoc still takes a plain resolved key.

  Validation is scoped to what ISO 18013-5 Annex B actually specifies — a
  two-level IACA to Document Signer hierarchy, so no general RFC 5280 path
  building. Checks the leaf issuer DN against a configured anchor subject, the
  leaf signature against that anchor key, the leaf validity window, that the
  anchor is a CA (a DS certificate configured by mistake cannot become a root),
  and keyUsage.digitalSignature where present.

  Deliberately not checked, both documented in the module: revocation (CRL/OCSP
  needs egress and an unavailability policy — its own decision), and the ISO mDL
  EKU 1.0.18013.5.1.2, which the EUDI PID profile does not share, so enforcing it
  would reject valid PID credentials as what looks exactly like a trust failure.

  Fails closed. An empty anchor set is an error, not permissive — mdoc is the one
  format whose issuer is not a resolvable DID, so there is no safe default. The
  config field defaults to empty, so an existing config still loads and an upgrade
  neither breaks a deployment nor silently starts trusting mdocs.

  Anchors are inline PEM in [vault] rather than file paths: an enclave has no
  convenient filesystem, and inline values are covered by the effective-config
  digest boot attestation commits to, so a verifier can see which issuers a TEE
  VTA was trusting when it was attested.

  x509-parser takes the verify-aws feature rather than the default verify, which
  pulls ring — ring currently only reaches this workspace through a
  dev-dependency, while aws-lc-rs is already a real dependency. Same crypto, no
  new production tree.

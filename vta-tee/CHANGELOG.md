### Fixed

- **did-webvh**: Serialize versionTime log updates ([#1599](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1599))

* fix(did-webvh): serialize versionTime log updates

  Use one current-time policy for TEE genesis and runtime did:webvh
  updates. Wait for the next valid whole-second boundary, rechecking
  after wall-clock rollback, instead of backdating entries.

  Serialize same-DID log appends within a VTA process and add regression
  coverage for rapid updates, concurrent appends, legacy timestamps, and
  TEE genesis followed by an immediate validated update.



## [0.2.10](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.9...vta-tee-v0.2.10) — 2026-09-20


## [0.2.9](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.8...vta-tee-v0.2.9) — 2026-09-17


## [0.2.8](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.7...vta-tee-v0.2.8) — 2026-09-16

## [0.2.6](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.5...vta-tee-v0.2.6) — 2026-09-14


### Fixed

- **pnm-cli**: Anchor TEE bootstrap connect by DID and PCR0 ([#1454](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1454))

* fix(pnm-cli): anchor TEE bootstrap connect by DID and PCR0

  Add mutually exclusive --vta-did and --vta-url targets. Resolve WebVH locally without guessing a URL on failure, preserve the advertised REST endpoint, and reject credentials for a different VTA DID.

  Accept a pinned PCR0 as the online connect trust anchor without requiring the server-generated digest or an opt-out warning. Preserve explicit digest opt-out warnings, conflicting-flag errors, and mandatory offline digest verification.

  Add regression tests for target selection, strict endpoint resolution, credential identity checks, and anchor combinations. Update the PNM quick start and TEE bootstrap guide.

- **webvh**: Clamp versionTime against the previous log entry ([#1456](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1456))

* fix(tee): backdate WebVH genesis versionTime

  The TEE genesis path used the library's current-time default while
  runtime updates used PR #600's backdated timestamps. This caused the
  first update to have a lower versionTime than genesis, making the DID
  unresolvable.

  Apply the shared PR #600 backdating policy to TEE genesis and move the
  helper into vta-support so both TEE and service paths use one implementation.

## [0.2.3](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.2...vta-tee-v0.2.3) — 2026-09-06


### Fixed

- **tee**: Make allow_kms_reinit explicit authorization for reinit regardless of KMS failure type ([#1249](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1249))

* fix(tee): make allow_kms_reinit explicit authorization for reinit regardless of KMS failure type



## [0.2.2](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.1...vta-tee-v0.2.2) — 2026-09-01


## [0.2.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.2.0...vta-tee-v0.2.1) — 2026-08-29


## [0.2.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.1.10...vta-tee-v0.2.0) — 2026-08-28


### Chore

- **deps**: Aes-gcm 0.11, and stop the nonce conversions panicking ([#1173](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1173))


## [0.1.10](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.1.9...vta-tee-v0.1.10) — 2026-08-26


## [0.1.9](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.1.8...vta-tee-v0.1.9) — 2026-08-20


### Fixed

- **tee**: Bootstrap 410 and vsock enotconn ([#1003](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1003))

* fix(tee): retry transient ENOTCONN on first vsock config-overlay read

  tokio-vsock can report a stream connected just before Nitro finishes the
  nonblocking handshake, so the very first read on a fresh vsock:5800
  connection to the parent config server can return ENOTCONN even though
  the parent is listening and ready. Retry only that specific transient
  error kind with a short delay; any other I/O error still fails closed
  immediately, and the existing overall READ_TIMEOUT deadline still
  bounds the whole fetch.

  Adds positive (retries ENOTCONN then succeeds) and negative (does not
  retry PermissionDenied) unit tests against the inner read loop.



## [0.1.8](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.1.7...vta-tee-v0.1.8) — 2026-08-16


## [0.1.7](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.1.6...vta-tee-v0.1.7) — 2026-08-14


### Added

- **nitro**: Un-bake tenant config, deliver to the enclave over vsock ([#939](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/939))

* feat(nitro): un-bake tenant config, deliver to the enclave over vsock

  The Nitro enclave image no longer bakes tenant config.toml into the EIF, so one image (one PCR0) serves every tenant. The entrypoint fetches a versioned config envelope from the parent over vsock:5800 (bounded connect/read timeouts, 1 MB size cap, version check), fails closed unless VTA_ALLOW_DEFAULT_CONFIG=true, and writes /etc/vta/config.toml before start. Adds jq to the runtime; documents the KMS-policy isolation requirement and the tee-mode enforcement floor.



## [0.1.6](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-tee-v0.1.5...vta-tee-v0.1.6) — 2026-08-13


### Added

- **release**: Publish vta-service and its closure again ([#962](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/962))

* feat(release): publish vta-service and its closure again

  #938 unpublished `vta-service` and the twelve subsystem crates behind it,
  on the finding that nothing external depended on them. The audit read
  normal dependencies. `openvtc-core` depends on `vta-service` as a
  **dev-dependency**, for `test_support::MockVta` — an in-process VTA its
  end-to-end tests run against. That harness boots the real service, so no
  client crate can stand in for it.

  Unpublishing did not merely freeze the crate. It broke it.

  `vti-common` re-exports `vta_sdk::acl::{ActScope, ApproveScope,
  ContextDirection}` as its own public API, so **a re-export makes the
  re-exported crate's version part of your public API**: any graph
  combining `vti-common` with another `vta-sdk` consumer must resolve one
  `vta-sdk`. The frozen `vta-service` 0.14.37 asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21`
  while `vti-common` has moved to `^0.23`. A downstream `cargo update`
  resolves both and `vta-service` fails to compile with

    expected `vti_common::acl::ApproveScope`,
       found `vta_sdk::acl::ApproveScope`

  at ten call sites — which is how this surfaced, in openvtc #213. Nothing
  downstream can fix that; only a release that moves the requirements
  together can.

  So the thirteen manifests go back to the workspace default. The cost is
  the closure — twelve subsystem crates return to crates.io, which is
  exactly what #938 set out to stop. Taken deliberately over the
  alternatives: yanking the published copies breaks OpenVTC's tests with no
  replacement, and leaving them up ships a crate on the registry that
  cannot be built.

  **On release ordering.** `cargo publish --dry-run -p vta-service` fails
  today, and will until the closure is on the registry: packaging strips
  path deps, so `vta-keys = "0.2"` resolves the *published* 0.2.1, which
  still asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21` — two nodes, same error. That resolves
  itself in the release, which publishes in dependency order: every
  subsystem crate in this workspace already requires `vta-sdk = "0.23"`, so
  once they upload, `vta-service` verifies against them. Crates whose
  dependencies are all published already dry-run clean (verified on
  `vta-keyspaces` and `vta-config`).

  Docs updated to match: CLAUDE.md, RELEASING.md and the release-plz.toml
  header all said 7-of-21. They now say 20-of-26, name the six that stay
  internal, and record the rule the audit missed — check dev-dependencies,
  in sibling repos, before unpublishing anything.



### Build & CI

- **release**: Adopt release-plz, publish 7 crates instead of 21 ([#938](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/938))

Merging and releasing were the same act. publish.yml fired on every push to
  main and shipped whatever versions were newly present, and a CI guard required
  the version bump to live in the feature PR — so every PR was a release
  decision, taken by whoever opened it, days before it merged. Two open PRs
  touching one crate wrote the same number into the same line of the same
  Cargo.toml, and the second to merge had to rebase, renumber, and fix a
  changelog entry that had gone stale. #932/#936/#937 hit it three times in one
  afternoon.

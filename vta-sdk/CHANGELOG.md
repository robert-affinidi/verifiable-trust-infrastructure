## [0.25.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-sdk-v0.24.0...vta-sdk-v0.25.0) — 2026-08-17


### Added

- **vta-keys**: Add non-extractable internal signing keys ([#995](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/995))

An ordinary VTA key is BIP-32 derived, so anyone holding the 24-word mnemonic
  can reconstruct it offline. That is what makes the VTA recoverable, and equally
  what makes "the operator cannot obtain this key" false — the second limb of what
  eIDAS calls sole control.

  An internal key is generated from the system CSPRNG, has no derivation path, and
  is never returned by any surface. The VTA acts only as a signing oracle for it.

  Deliberately not a flag on the imported-key path. That path wraps its secrets
  under a KEK derived from the master seed (derive_kek(seed, salt)), so a
  non-extractable flag on it would be decorative: the boundary it claims to
  enforce has already been walked around. Internal keys get their own keyspace,
  INTERNAL_KEYS, with no seed involvement at any point, and that keyspace is in
  EXCLUDED_FROM_BACKUP by design — a backup carrying it would be an export of keys
  the VTA promises never to export, and restoring it elsewhere would clone a
  signer.

  Refused for did:webvh log entries, enforced in code rather than left to
  guidance. WebVH is append-only and each entry is authorised by the update key
  the previous entry named; an unrecoverable update key means that if storage is
  lost the DID can never be updated again by anyone, permanently, and every
  integration pinned to it is stranded. Credentials can be re-issued, an
  append-only identity log cannot. Internal keys remain fine as a signing
  verificationMethod inside a published document, where loss costs the ability to
  produce new signatures rather than control of the identity.

  The export refusal is not a permission check — admin is not a bypass, because
  the value of the origin is that no caller holds this power. There are two
  refusals (an early return and an in-match arm); removing either leaves the other,
  and removing both does not compile, since the match over KeyOrigin becomes
  non-exhaustive. An export path cannot silently reopen.

  Operator surfaces carry the cost prominently: `pnm keys create --internal`
  prints what is lost and requires the operator to type a confirmation phrase
  rather than mash y, the response repeats the warning, and docs/02-vta/
  internal-keys.md covers when to use one, what actually protects it (enclave
  measurement + KMS, not a mnemonic), and the two things that genuinely destroy
  it.

- **vta-service**: Present ISO mdoc credentials over OID4VP ([#993](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/993))

* feat(vta-service)!: present ISO mdoc credentials over OID4VP

  Completes mdoc support. A VTA could receive, verify and store an mdoc; it could
  not present one. This is the last piece, and it needed three things the other
  formats do not.

  An OID4VP session on the query wire. An mdoc's holder binding is a DeviceAuth
  signature over an ISO 18013-7 SessionTranscript, whose handover is
  [clientId, responseUri, nonce, mdocGeneratedNonce]. Two of those exist only in
  an OID4VP exchange, so a verifier that wants an mdoc supplies them; QueryBody
  gains an optional oid4vp_session carrying OID4VP's own field names, so a
  verifier can copy them out of its authorization request unrenamed.

  Absent, an mdoc is not offered at all rather than offered unbound. A DeviceAuth
  over invented handover values verifies nowhere and, worse, looks bound. The gate
  lives in match_held so matchable and presentable stay the same set: a
  matched-but-unpresentable credential bails the entire vp_token, not just itself,
  taking every other credential the verifier legitimately asked for with it. A
  mutation removing the gate fails the test that pins this.

  Holder identity that is key-shaped. ConsentGrant.holder_did becomes
  HolderIdentity::{Subject, DeviceKey}: every other format names a subject DID,
  while an mdoc names a device key discovered at receive. Both resolve to a
  did:key because ConsentRecord::verify_proof binds the proof's
  verificationMethod to the data subject — the variant records provenance that
  would otherwise be silently lost, not a different kind of value.

  A P-256 consent receipt. The device key signs its own receipt under
  ecdsa-jcs-2019 (affinidi-data-integrity 0.7.10), where every other format uses
  eddsa-jcs-2022. Signing the receipt with some other key would break the
  verificationMethod binding above; that is why the cryptosuite was added upstream
  rather than worked around here.

  Presentation itself is not a present_single arm: an mdoc vp_token entry is
  base64url CBOR of a DeviceResponse, not a W3C VP object, so present_mdoc sits
  beside it. Selective disclosure is by omission — only the [namespace, element]
  paths the query asked for are included.



## [0.24.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-sdk-v0.23.3...vta-sdk-v0.24.0) — 2026-08-16


### Added

- **vtc**: Let an applicant poll a join without knowing its request id ([#985](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/985))

The status poll exists so an applicant can find out what became of a join
  the community never volunteered an answer for. It could not be used for
  that.

  The id it takes is the *community's*, minted here on submit and learned by
  the applicant from the first correlated reply. An applicant that never
  received that reply — the exact failure the poll is meant to recover from
  — holds only the id of the document it sent, which this VTC has never
  heard of, and gets `not found` for it. So the poll worked whenever it was
  not needed and failed whenever it was.

  Downstream the two recovery paths shared the blind spot and failed
  together: OpenVTC gates polling on having a confirmed id, and its other
  recovery (collecting stored mail) is empty once the mail has been acked
  and deleted. The record then sits Pending forever with no way back —
  OpenVTC/openvtc#221, where the only fix was hand-editing a config file.

  `requestId` is now optional. Omitted, it means "what is my open request?",
  and the community resolves it from the authenticated applicant. That is
  safe and unambiguous for the same reason the dedup on submit is: at most
  one request per applicant is open at a time, and the applicant is already
  proven by the authcrypt sender over DIDComm/TSP. No new auth surface, no
  new route, no new domain tag — the id simply stops being the only way to
  name a request.

  The response has always carried `requestId`, so one id-less poll also
  repairs the applicant's record and every later poll can quote it. That is
  what turns this from a query into a recovery.

  `find_open_request` is now `pub(crate)`: it was the dedup's private
  helper, and it is the same invariant both callers rely on.

  REST keeps requiring the id — it is a path segment there, and the stranded
  case is a messaging one. Worth revisiting if a REST applicant ever hits it.



## [0.23.3](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-sdk-v0.23.2...vta-sdk-v0.23.3) — 2026-08-14


### Added

- **nitro**: Un-bake tenant config, deliver to the enclave over vsock ([#939](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/939))

* feat(nitro): un-bake tenant config, deliver to the enclave over vsock

  The Nitro enclave image no longer bakes tenant config.toml into the EIF, so one image (one PCR0) serves every tenant. The entrypoint fetches a versioned config envelope from the parent over vsock:5800 (bounded connect/read timeouts, 1 MB size cap, version check), fails closed unless VTA_ALLOW_DEFAULT_CONFIG=true, and writes /etc/vta/config.toml before start. Adds jq to the runtime; documents the KMS-policy isolation requirement and the tee-mode enforcement floor.



## [0.23.2](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-sdk-v0.23.1...vta-sdk-v0.23.2) — 2026-08-14


## [0.23.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-sdk-v0.23.0...vta-sdk-v0.23.1) — 2026-08-14


### Added

- **webvh**: Find DIDs a host serves that this VTA has no record of ([#976](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/976))

A DID can exist on a hosting server and nowhere in the VTA that owns it. The
  delete path says so out loud: `delete_did_webvh` calls the host first and, when
  that call fails, logs "continuing local cleanup but DID is now orphaned on the
  daemon" and removes the local record anyway. The host keeps serving a DID whose
  controller has discarded its keys, and nothing since then could tell you.

  Found the hard way: the hosting UI listed a DID, a delegated edit against it was
  refused with `did not found: SCID … not found`, and from the outside that reads
  as lost keys rather than an orphan.

      pnm did-mgmt dids reconcile --server primary

  Read-only, and repairs nothing on purpose — a host-only entry wants removing at
  the host, a local-only entry wants its publish retrying, and neither is safe to
  infer from a list. Naming them is the job.

  **Only the VTA can answer it.** The operator holds no credentials for the
  hosting server; the host has no view of the VTA's records. So the VTA
  authenticates with its own credentials, reads `GET /api/dids?owner=<its own
  DID>`, and compares against its local records.

  Three decisions worth the reviewer's attention:

  - **`owner` is always sent**, though the endpoint allows omitting it. A VTA that
    administers its own host *is* an admin caller, and the host answers an admin
    who names no owner with every DID on the server — reporting every other
    tenant's DID as missing locally.
  - **Matched on the host's slot id, not the DID.** A slot reserved but never
    published to has no DID at all and is exactly as orphaned as one that was.
    Pinned by a test.
  - **Super-admin, and DIDComm-only registrations are refused.** The host has no
    notion of VTA contexts, so its listing cannot be filtered by
    `has_context_access` the way `dids list` filters local records — and scoping
    the *result* instead would hide orphans from everyone, since an orphan has no
    local record to carry a context. The host's listing is REST-only, so against a
    DIDComm-only server this errors rather than returning an empty diff: "nothing
    to report" is the one wrong answer available, because it is the answer an
    operator stops looking after.

  ## The registry cost, stated plainly

  This adds one URI — `vta/webvh/servers/dids/0.1` — that the published registry
  has no spec for, so it lands on **both** drift registers: the per-family census
  in `vtc-service` (spec/vta 36 → 37) and the per-URI
  `UNSPECCED_DISPATCHED_URIS` in this crate, whose own rule reads "author the spec
  upstream — growing the allowlist is the wrong fix".

  It is added knowingly. The spec cannot come first from inside this repo: it
  needs a PR to trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf and a `trust-tasks-rs` release
  before the URI resolves, which is how every entry on that list arrived. The
  disposition is **spec under `vta/`**, recorded in `registry-drift-triage.md`
  beside `servers/{list,register,remove}` and for the same reason: the subject is
  the VTA's own view of a host it uses, and `did-management/did/list/0.1` is the
  host's listing rather than the comparison against local records. The nearest
  sibling shows the way out — `servers/domains/0.1` relays the same host's domain
  view, went upstream as dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#171, and is on neither list as a
  result.

  The alternatives were weighed and are worse: a REST-only route is unreachable
  from a TSP-transport CLI, and folding this onto `webvh/dids/list/1.0` makes a
  local read do network I/O and grows a response shape most callers never want.

  The `did-hosting-ui` half — the warning beside the delegated-edit button, and
  the hint that names this command when the agent answers "not found" — is
  affinidi/affinidi-webvh-service#163.



## [0.23.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-sdk-v0.22.0...vta-sdk-v0.23.0) — 2026-08-12


### Added

- **did-webvh**: Let a minted DID advertise TSP at the VTA's mediator ([#959](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/959))

A VTA-minted DID could never advertise TSP, whatever the VTA's own config
  said. `add_mediator_service` publishes the VTA's mediator as a
  `DIDCommMessaging` service and nothing else, so a caller wanting `#tsp`
  had to hand-build the service entry and pass it through
  `additional_services` — which means knowing the mediator DID, the one
  thing `add_mediator_service` exists so a caller does not have to know.
  Nobody did, so every persona-shaped identity is DIDComm-only by
  construction, and the both-ends transport rule can never resolve to TSP
  for one. TSP could be enabled end to end and the intersection would still
  be DIDComm.

  Surfaced by OpenVTC #211, where a join failed at the mediator and the
  applicant persona's document turned out to carry exactly one service
  entry.

  Adds `add_tsp_service` to the create-DID wire, honoured by
  `with_tsp_service` in `did_webvh/document.rs`. The entry points at the
  same mediator the DIDComm entry names — TSP advertises a mediator DID,
  not a transport URL (D8) — using the fragment and type the setup path and
  the runtime `services tsp enable` patcher already emit, so a document
  minted here, minted at setup, or patched later are the same shape.

  Two gates, neither redundant. The caller's flag is opt-in and
  deliberately not implied by `add_mediator_service`: a DID advertising a
  transport its holder cannot decode is unreachable over that transport,
  and only the caller knows whether the client behind the DID reads TSP
  frames. Ours is `[services] tsp` plus a configured mediator: a VTA whose
  own stack does not run TSP must not mint documents claiming it does,
  which is the failure this prevents rather than spreads. A caller-supplied
  `TSPTransport` entry wins over the injected one — matched on the service
  `type`, never the `#id` fragment.

  Additive on the wire in both directions: `skip_serializing_if` on the
  request and `Option` on the body, so an unset field serialises exactly as
  before and a VTA that predates it ignores the key.



## [0.22.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-sdk-v0.21.21...vta-sdk-v0.22.0) — 2026-08-12


### Fixed

- **vault**: Send entryId on vault release, from both the CLI and the MCP bridge ([#948](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/948))

* fix(vault): use entryId instead of id in vault release payload

  cmd_vault_release was constructing the vault/release/0.1 Trust Task
  payload with key `id`, which fails schema validation. The schema
  requires `entryId` (matching VaultReleaseBody's camelCase
  serialisation on the server side).

- **provisioning**: Relay the holder's bootstrap VP as raw JSON ([#949](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/949))

A relayer is usually not the holder — the air-gap onboarding flow exists
  precisely so it isn't — so `pnm bootstrap provision-integration` forwards
  a document some other process signed. It parsed that document into a
  typed `BootstrapRequest` and let serde re-render it on the way out, so
  the maintainer verified bytes the holder never signed. Both transports,
  every relayed request.

  Same defect as #946 one layer up, and with the same trigger: #917 moved
  `ask.type` to the 0.2 camelCase tag, so a holder on vta-sdk < 0.21.11
  (did-hosting `VTI-Cypress-RC-1` among them) has its own valid signature
  rewritten in transit and rejected as a forgery at the far end. #946 fixed
  the two maintainer-side surfaces that re-serialised; this is the client
  side of the same rule, and the two together close the flow.

  `ProvisionIntegrationRequest.request` and `provision_integration_didcomm`
  now take `serde_json::Value`. **Breaking** for anything constructing that
  struct. Callers that signed the VP themselves — every SDK runner — go
  through the new `BootstrapRequest::to_signed_wire_value`, where serde
  output and signed bytes are the same document by construction; pnm keeps
  a typed view purely to read `contextHint` and relays the raw JSON.

  `provision_integration_didcomm`'s doc comment already promised the VP was
  "left byte-identical either way". It now is.

  The existing relay tests could not have caught this: they assert the body
  carries `serde_json::to_value(&vp)`, which is the SDK's rendering
  compared against itself and true however badly the relayer mangles a
  foreign document. The new test starts from a VP this crate did not
  render, relays it under both spec versions, and requires it to arrive
  byte-for-byte and still verify. It also asserts the fixture actually
  diverges from this crate's serde output, so it fails loudly rather than
  going quietly vacuous if the casings ever converge.

- **provisioning**: Verify the bootstrap VP as received, not re-serialised ([#946](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/946))

`vta bootstrap provision-integration` and `POST /bootstrap/provision-integration`
  rejected a validly-signed request from any holder on vta-sdk < 0.21.11:

      Error: verify BootstrapRequest: proof verification failed:
      verify VP: signature invalid for cryptosuite EddsaJcs2022

  Both called `BootstrapRequest::verify()`, which re-serialises the typed
  struct and re-imposes this crate's casing on the bytes the holder signed.
  #917 flipped `ask.type` to the 0.2 camelCase tag (`templateBootstrap`),
  so a 0.1 holder's `TemplateBootstrap` — accepted on the way in by the
  serde alias, then re-emitted camelCase on the way to the verifier — no
  longer matched its own signature. The failure is indistinguishable from
  a forgery, which is what makes it expensive to diagnose in the field.
  did-hosting `VTI-Cypress-RC-1` pins vta-sdk 0.21.9 and hits this on
  every offline provision.

  #917 fixed exactly this defect at the Trust-Task handler and the DIDComm
  handler already did the right thing; the offline CLI and the REST route
  were the two surfaces left behind. Both now go through `verify_value`
  over the bytes as received, which is what its own docs require of any
  surface taking a request from elsewhere. The REST body consequently
  carries `request` as raw JSON — deserialising it into the typed struct
  at the extractor is what discarded the signed bytes. `deny_unknown_fields`
  still rejects smuggled fields, one layer in, inside `verify_value`.

  Tests cover the direction that was missing. #917's fixture signed the
  0.2 casing against a 0.2 maintainer; nothing exercised an *older* holder
  against a current one, which is the far commoner deployment shape. Added
  a PascalCase-signed fixture at both layers, plus a test pinning that
  `verify()` breaks such a request — so a call site reverting to it fails
  rather than shipping.

  Note for follow-up: the relayer has the same defect one layer up.
  `ProvisionIntegrationRequest.request` is a typed `BootstrapRequest`, so
  `pnm bootstrap provision-integration` re-serialises a request file before
  sending it (both transports), and the maintainer never sees the signed
  bytes. `provision_integration_didcomm`'s doc comment already claims the
  VP is "left byte-identical either way", which the code does not honour.
  Fixing it changes a published vta-sdk struct field, so it is deliberately
  not bundled here.
